#+title: corfu.el - Changelog
#+author: Daniel Mendler

* Version 2.2 (2025-05-26)

- Guard Corfu hooks to automatically print stack traces in order to ease
  debugging.

* Version 2.1 (2025-04-22)

- =corfu-history-duplicate= and =corfu-history-decay=: New customization options to
  adjust the rank of duplicate history elements, such that they appear earlier
  in the completion list.
- =corfu-history-mode=: Add =corfu-history= to =savehist-minibuffer-history-variables=
  in order to save the history if =savehist-mode= is enabled.

* Version 2.0 (2025-03-28)

- ~corfu-quick~: Ensure that popup does not move.

* Version 1.7 (2025-01-28)

- Bugfixes only.

* Version 1.6 (2024-12-22)

- Require Emacs 28.1.
- Use fringe to display scroll bar. This change improves performance and makes
  sure that the scroll bar cannot be pushed outside the child frame by the
  content. This affects for example ~cape-emoji~.
- Improve suffix alignment.
- Remember popup width during completion to avoid width fluctuations. Basically
  the popup is only allowed to grow.
- ~corfu-insert-separator~: Jump back to prompt if a candidate is previewed.

* Version 1.5 (2024-07-26)

- New customization variable =global-corfu-minibuffer= to enable Corfu in the
  minibuffer.
- Unbind =C-a= in =corfu-map=. This binding is only needed in modes which override
  =C-a= instead of remapping ~move-beginning-of-line~.
- Unbind =<tab>= in ~corfu-map~. This binding is only needed in modes which bind
  =<tab>= instead of =TAB=, as was the case in old versions of Org. If you use such
  a mode, please report this as a bug for this mode. In the meantime you can use
  =(keymap-set corfu-map "<tab>" #'corfu-complete)=.
- Add new command ~corfu-send~ as alternative to ~corfu-insert~.
- =corfu-popupinfo=: Support both =face= and =font-lock-face= highlighting.
- Bump Compat dependency to Compat 30.

* Version 1.4 (2024-05-23)

- ~corfu-auto-commands~: Add ~delete-backward-char~.

* Version 1.3 (2024-04-05)

- Preserve currently selected candidate on further input. This matters if
  candidate preview is disabled (~corfu-preview-current=nil~).
- Add new command ~corfu-expand~ bound to ~M-TAB~ by default. The command expands
  the input via ~completion-try-completion~, for example the ~basic~ completion
  style expands the common prefix of all candidates.

* Version 1.2 (2024-01-23)

- Support the EXWM window manager.
- Optimization: Reduce auto completion timer overhead.
- Use ~internal-border-width~ instead of ~child-frame-border-width~.
- Internal refactoring: Do not use buffer-local variables.
- Internal refactoring: Store ~completion-extra-properties~ as part of
  ~completion-in-region--data~.

* Version 1.1 (2023-12-27)

- Deduplicate candidates with respect to ~equal-including-properties~, such that
  backends can provide equal candidate strings, which only differ in their text
  properties and annotations.
- Ensure that the string passed to the ~:exit-function~ retains the candidate
  properties, when possible. The properties are guaranteed to exist when a
  candidate is selected explicitly, but may be missing when candidates are
  completed in a stepwise manner.
- ~corfu-on-exact-match~: Add value ~show~ to the customization option. With this
  setting the Corfu popup will be shown even if there is only a single matching
  candidate.

* Version 1.0 (2023-12-01)

- Bug fixes.
- =corfu-quick=: Use a slightly different scheme to support more candidates.
- =corfu-reset=: Quit immediately if input did not change.
- Support =completion-lazy-hilit=.

* Version 0.38 (2023-08-14)

- =corfu-quick=: Bugfix.
- =corfu-mode-map=: Add mode map.
- Replace =corfu-excluded-modes= with =global-corfu-modes=, the Emacs 28 convention
  for globalized minor modes.

* Version 0.37 (2023-07-02)

- Bugfixes.
- Improve child frame display code, =corfu--popup-show= takes a =posn= argument.
- Ensure that the popup font matches the font of the parent frame.
- Close popup when window selection changes.
- Remove =corfu-history-length=. Instead set the =history-length= property of
  =corfu-history= variable.
- =corfu-info-documentation=, =corfu-info-location=: Make buffer and window
  persistent if called with prefix argument.

* Version 0.36 (2023-03-27)

- Drop obsolete =corfu-preselect-first=.
- =corfu-popupinfo-delay= and =corfu-echo-delay=: Remove support for value =t=.
  Instant updates are not recommended. It is still possible to use a small value
  for the delay.
- Rename =corfu-excluded-modes= to =corfu-exclude-modes= (Naming convention).
- Remove call to =undo-boundary=, which caused issues with auto completion.

* Version 0.35 (2023-02-17)

- =corfu-popupinfo=: Take more text into account when computing popup width.
- =corfu-popupinfo=: Change keybindings, remap =corfu-info-documentation/location=.
- =corfu-popupinfo=: Add commands =corfu-popupinfo-beginning/end=.
- =corfu-popupinfo=: Improve popup placement.
- Add =corfu-prompt-beginning= and =corfu-prompt-end= commands.
- Add =corfu-preselect= option, deprecate =corfu-preselect-first=.
- Use =cl-defgeneric= internally as mechanism to allow extensions to override
  functionality, e.g., the candidate formatting and display.

- Bugfixes
- Popup frame code updated for Emacs 29. Please report any issues.

* Version 0.29 (2022-11-19)

- BREAKING: Extract the =corfu-echo= extension from =corfu.el=. In order to see echo
  messages, enable =corfu-echo-mode=. You probably want to enable either
  =corfu-echo-mode= or =corfu-popupinfo-mode=.
- BREAKING: Rename =corfu-echo-documentation= to =corfu-echo-delay=.
- Add =corfu-popupinfo= extension to display candidate documentation and location
  in a small child frame next to the candidate menu. This extension has been
  contributed by Yuwei Tian who assigned copyright to the FSF. The extension
  supersedes Yuwei's =corfu-doc= package.
