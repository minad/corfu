#+title: corfu.el - Changelog
#+author: Daniel Mendler
#+language: en

* Development

- Require Emacs 28.1.
- Use fringe to display scroll bar. Make sure that the scroll bar cannot be
  pushed outside the child frame by the content. This affects for example
  ~cape-emoji~.
- New face ~corfu-scroll-bar~ which replaces the old face ~corfu-bar~. For technical
  reasons the foreground color is used for the scroll bar, and not the
  background as for the old face.
- Renamed ~corfu-bar-width~ to ~corfu-scroll-bar-width~ for consistency.
- Improve suffix alignment.

* Version 1.5 (2024-07-26)

- New customization variable =global-corfu-minibuffer= to enable Corfu in the
  minibuffer.
- Unbind =C-a= in =corfu-map=. This binding is only needed in modes which override
  =C-a= instead of remapping ~move-beginning-of-line~.
- Unbind =<tab>= in ~corfu-map~. This binding is only needed in modes which bind
  =<tab>= instead of =TAB=, as was the case in old versions of Org. If you use such
  a mode, please report this as a bug for this mode. In the meantime you can use
  =(keymap-set corfu-map "<tab>" #'corfu-complete)=.
- Add new command ~corfu-send~ as alternative to ~corfu-insert~.
- =corfu-popupinfo=: Support both =face= and =font-lock-face= highlighting.
- Bump Compat dependency to Compat 30.

* Version 1.4 (2024-05-23)

- ~corfu-auto-commands~: Add ~delete-backward-char~.

* Version 1.3 (2024-04-05)

- Preserve currently selected candidate on further input. This matters if
  candidate preview is disabled (~corfu-preview-current=nil~).
- Add new command ~corfu-expand~ bound to ~M-TAB~ by default. The command expands
  the input via ~completion-try-completion~, for example the ~basic~ completion
  style expands the common prefix of all candidates.

* Version 1.2 (2024-01-23)

- Support the EXWM window manager.
- Optimization: Reduce auto completion timer overhead.
- Use ~internal-border-width~ instead of ~child-frame-border-width~.
- Internal refactoring: Do not use buffer-local variables.
- Internal refactoring: Store ~completion-extra-properties~ as part of
  ~completion-in-region--data~.

* Version 1.1 (2023-12-27)

- Deduplicate candidates with respect to ~equal-including-properties~, such that
  backends can provide equal candidate strings, which only differ in their text
  properties and annotations.
- Ensure that the string passed to the ~:exit-function~ retains the candidate
  properties, when possible. The properties are guaranteed to exist when a
  candidate is selected explicitly, but may be missing when candidates are
  completed in a stepwise manner.
- ~corfu-on-exact-match~: Add value ~show~ to the customization option. With this
  setting the Corfu popup will be shown even if there is only a single matching
  candidate.

* Version 1.0 (2023-12-01)

- Bug fixes.
- =corfu-quick=: Use a slightly different scheme to support more candidates.
- =corfu-reset=: Quit immediately if input did not change.
- Support =completion-lazy-hilit=.

* Version 0.38 (2023-08-14)

- =corfu-quick=: Bugfix.
- =corfu-mode-map=: Add mode map.
- Replace =corfu-excluded-modes= with =global-corfu-modes=, the Emacs 28 convention
  for globalized minor modes.

* Version 0.37 (2023-07-02)

- Bugfixes.
- Improve child frame display code, =corfu--popup-show= takes a =posn= argument.
- Ensure that the popup font matches the font of the parent frame.
- Close popup when window selection changes.
- Remove =corfu-history-length=. Instead set the =history-length= property of
  =corfu-history= variable.
- =corfu-info-documentation=, =corfu-info-location=: Make buffer and window
  persistent if called with prefix argument.

* Version 0.36 (2023-03-27)

- Drop obsolete =corfu-preselect-first=.
- =corfu-popupinfo-delay= and =corfu-echo-delay=: Remove support for value =t=.
  Instant updates are not recommended. It is still possible to use a small value
  for the delay.
- Rename =corfu-excluded-modes= to =corfu-exclude-modes= (Naming convention).
- Remove call to =undo-boundary=, which caused issues with auto completion.

* Version 0.35 (2023-02-17)

- =corfu-popupinfo=: Take more text into account when computing popup width.
- =corfu-popupinfo=: Change keybindings, remap =corfu-info-documentation/location=.
- =corfu-popupinfo=: Add commands =corfu-popupinfo-beginning/end=.
- =corfu-popupinfo=: Improve popup placement.
- Add =corfu-prompt-beginning= and =corfu-prompt-end= commands.
- Add =corfu-preselect= option, deprecate =corfu-preselect-first=.
- Use =cl-defgeneric= internally as mechanism to allow extensions to override
  functionality, e.g., the candidate formatting and display.

* Version 0.34 (2022-12-03)

- Bugfixes
- Popup frame code updated for Emacs 29. Please report any issues.

* Version 0.29 (2022-11-19)

- BREAKING: Extract the =corfu-echo= extension from =corfu.el=. In order to see echo
  messages, enable =corfu-echo-mode=. You probably want to enable either
  =corfu-echo-mode= or =corfu-popupinfo-mode=.
- BREAKING: Rename =corfu-echo-documentation= to =corfu-echo-delay=.
- Add =corfu-popupinfo= extension to display candidate documentation and location
  in a small child frame next to the candidate menu. This extension has been
  contributed by Yuwei Tian who assigned copyright to the FSF. The extension
  supersedes Yuwei's =corfu-doc= package.
