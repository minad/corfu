* Introduction

  Corfu enhances the default completion in region function with a completion
  overlay. The current candidates are shown in a popup below or above the point.
  Corfu is the minimalistic ~completion-in-region~ counterpart of the [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][Vertico]]
  minibuffer UI.

  Corfu is a minimal package, which relies on the Emacs completion facilities
  and concentrates on providing a polished completion UI. Completions are either
  provided by commands like ~dabbrev-completion~ or by pluggable backends
  (~completion-at-point-functions~, Capfs). Most programming language major modes
  implement a Capf. Furthermore the language server packages, [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][Eglot]] and
  [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][Lsp-mode]], use Capfs which talk to the LSP server to retrieve the completions.
  Corfu does not include its own completion backends. The Emacs built-in Capfs
  and the Capfs provided by other packages are usually sufficient, but a few
  additional Capfs and completion functions are provided by the [[https://github.com/minad/cape][Cape]] package.

  *NOTE*: Corfu uses child frames to show the popup. For now Corfu falls back to
  the default setting of the ~completion-in-region-function~ on non-graphical
  displays.

* Features

  - Timer-based auto-completions (/off/ by default, set ~corfu-auto~).
  - Popup display with scrollbar indicator and arrow key navigation.
  - The popup can be summoned explicitly by pressing =TAB= at any time.
  - The current candidate is inserted with =TAB= and selected with =RET=.
  - Candidates sorting by prefix, string length and alphabetically.
  - The selected candidate is previewed (configuable via ~corfu-preview-current~).
  - The selected candidate automatically committed on further input by default
    (configurable via ~corfu-commit-predicate~).
  - The [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][Orderless]] completion style is supported. The filter string can contain
    arbitrary characters, including spaces, if ~corfu-quit-at-boundary~ is nil.
  - Deferred completion style highlighting for performance.
  - Jumping to location/documentation of current candidate.
  - Show candidate documentation/signature string in the echo area.
  - Deprecated candidates are crossed out in the display.
  - Support for annotations (~annotation-function~, ~affixation-function~).
  - Icons can be provided by an external package via margin formatter functions.

* Installation and Configuration

  Corfu is available from [[http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/corfu.html][GNU ELPA]], such that it can be installed directly via
  ~package-install~. After installation, the global minor mode can be enabled with
  =M-x corfu-global-mode=. In order to configure Corfu and other packages in your
  init.el, you may want to use ~use-package~.

  Corfu is highly flexible and customizable via ~corfu-*~ customization variables.
  For filtering I recommend to give Orderless completion a try, which is
  different from the familiar prefix TAB completion. Corfu can be used with the
  default completion styles, the use of Orderless is not a necessity. See also
  the [[https://github.com/minad/corfu/wiki][Corfu Wiki]] for additional configuration tips. In particular the Lsp-mode
  configuration is documented in the Wiki.

  Here is an example configuration:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package corfu
      ;; Optional customizations
      ;; :custom
      ;; (corfu-cycle t)                ;; Enable cycling for `corfu-next/previous'
      ;; (corfu-auto t)                 ;; Enable auto completion
      ;; (corfu-commit-predicate nil)   ;; Do not commit selected candidates on next input
      ;; (corfu-quit-at-boundary t)     ;; Automatically quit at word boundary
      ;; (corfu-quit-no-match t)        ;; Automatically quit if there is no match
      ;; (corfu-preview-current nil)    ;; Disable current candidate preview
      ;; (corfu-preselect-first nil)    ;; Disable candidate preselection
      ;; (corfu-echo-documentation nil) ;; Disable documentation in the echo area
      ;; (corfu-scroll-margin 5)        ;; Use scroll margin

      ;; You may want to enable Corfu only for certain modes.
      ;; :hook ((prog-mode . corfu-mode)
      ;;        (shell-mode . corfu-mode)
      ;;        (eshell-mode . corfu-mode))

      ;; Recommended: Enable Corfu globally.
      ;; This is recommended since dabbrev can be used globally (M-/).
      :init
      (corfu-global-mode))

    ;; Optionally use the `orderless' completion style. See `+orderless-dispatch'
    ;; in the Consult wiki for an advanced Orderless style dispatcher.
    ;; Enable `partial-completion' for files to allow path expansion.
    ;; You may prefer to use `initials' instead of `partial-completion'.
    (use-package orderless
      :init
      ;; Configure a custom style dispatcher (see the Consult wiki)
      ;; (setq orderless-style-dispatchers '(+orderless-dispatch)
      ;;       orderless-component-separator #'orderless-escapable-split-on-space)
      (setq completion-styles '(orderless)
            completion-category-defaults nil
            completion-category-overrides '((file (styles . (partial-completion))))))

    ;; Use dabbrev with Corfu!
    (use-package dabbrev
      ;; Swap M-/ and C-M-/
      :bind (("M-/" . dabbrev-completion)
             ("C-M-/" . dabbrev-expand)))

    ;; A few more useful configurations...
    (use-package emacs
      :init
      ;; TAB cycle if there are only few candidates
      (setq completion-cycle-threshold 3)

      ;; Emacs 28: Hide commands in M-x which do not apply to the current mode.
      ;; Corfu commands are hidden, since they are not supposed to be used via M-x.
      ;; (setq read-extended-command-predicate
      ;;       #'command-completion-default-include-p)

      ;; Enable indentation+completion using the TAB key.
      ;; `completion-at-point' is often bound to M-TAB.
      (setq tab-always-indent 'complete))
  #+end_src

  See also the [[https://github.com/minad/corfu/wiki][Corfu Wiki]] for additional configuration tips. For more general
  documentation read the chapter about completion in the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Completion.html][Emacs manual]]. If you
  want to create your own Capfs, you can find documentation about completion in
  the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Completion.html][Elisp manual]].

** TAB-and-Go completion

You may be interested in configuring Corfu in TAB-and-Go style. Pressing TAB
moves to the next candidate and further input will then commit the selection.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package corfu
    ;; TAB-and-Go customizations
    :custom
    (corfu-cycle t)             ;; Enable cycling for `corfu-next/previous'
    (corfu-preselect-first nil) ;; Disable candidate preselection

    ;; Use TAB for cycling, default is `corfu-complete'.
    :bind
    (:map corfu-map
          ("TAB" . corfu-next)
          ([tab] . corfu-next)
          ("S-TAB" . corfu-previous)
          ([backtab] . corfu-previous))

    :init
    (corfu-global-mode))
#+end_src

* Key bindings

  Corfu uses a transient keymap ~corfu-map~ which is active while the popup is shown.
  The keymap defines the following remappings and bindings:

  - ~beginning-of-buffer~ -> ~corfu-first~
  - ~end-of-buffer~ -> ~corfu-last~
  - ~scroll-down-command~ -> ~corfu-scroll-down~
  - ~scroll-up-command~ -> ~corfu-scroll-up~
  - ~next-line~, =down=, =M-n= -> ~corfu-next~
  - ~previous-line~, =up=, =M-p= -> ~corfu-previous~
  - ~completion-at-point~, =TAB= -> ~corfu-complete~
  - =RET= -> ~corfu-insert~
  - =M-g= -> ~corfu-show-location~
  - =M-h= -> ~corfu-show-documentation~
  - =C-g= -> ~corfu-quit~
  - ~keyboard-escape-quit~ -> ~corfu-reset~

* Complementary packages

  Corfu works well together with all packages providing code completion via the
  ~completion-at-point-functions~. Many modes and packages already provide a Capf
  out of the box. Nevertheless you may want to look into complementary packages
  to enhance your setup.

  - [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][Orderless]]: Cofu supports completion styles,
    including the advanced [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][Orderless]] completion style, where the filtering
    expressions are separated by spaces (see ~corfu-quit-at-boundary~).

  - [[https://github.com/minad/cape][Cape]]: I collect additional Capf backends and =completion-in-region= commands
    in my [[https://github.com/minad/cape][Cape]] package. The package provides a file path, a dabbrev completion
    backend and a backend which allows you to enter unicode characters in the
    form of TeX commands. Cape provides an adapter to reuse Company backends in
    Corfu. Furthermore the function ~cape-super-capf~ can merge/groups multiple
    Capfs, such that the candidates of multiple Capfs are displayed together at
    the same time.

  - [[https://github.com/jdtsmith/kind-icon][kind-icon]]: Icons are supported by Corfu via an external package. For example
    the [[https://github.com/jdtsmith/kind-icon][kind-icon]] package provides beautifully styled SVG icons based on
    monochromatic icon sets like material design.

  - [[https://github.com/galeo/corfu-doc][corfu-doc]]: The corfu-doc package by @galeo allows you to display the candidate
    documentation in a popup next to the Corfu popup, similar to
    =company-quickhelp=. /Note that the corfu-doc package is new and still work in
    progress./

  - [[https://github.com/minad/tempel][Tempel]]: Tiny template/snippet package based on the Emacs Tempo library,
    which can be used in conjunction with Corfu.

  - [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][Vertico]]: You may also want to look into my [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][Vertico]] package. Vertico is the
    minibuffer completion counterpart of Corfu.

* Alternatives

  - [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode][Company]]: Company is a widely used and mature completion package, which
    implements a similar interaction model and popup UI as Corfu. While Corfu
    relies exclusively on the standard Emacs completion API (Capfs), Company
    defines its own API for the backends. Furthermore Company includes its
    completion backends, which are incompatible with the Emacs completion
    infrastructure. As a result of this design, Company is a more complex
    package than Corfu. Company by default uses overlays to display the popup in
    contrast to the child frames used by Corfu. Overall both packages work well.
    Company is more mature but the integration into Emacs is a bit less tight,
    since for example the ~completion-at-point~ command (or the
    ~completion-in-region~ function) does not invoke Company.

  - [[https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/mct][Mct]]: Protesilaos' Minibuffer Confines Transcended package supports both
    minibuffer completion and completion in region. It reuses the default
    completion UI for this purpose and installs a timer which live updates the
    completion buffer. The main advantage of Mct is that you work with a regular
    Emacs buffer instead of with a popup. You can take advantage of the usual
    Emacs commands to navigate in the completions buffer. On top, Mct enhances
    the movement such that you can quickly switch between the completions buffer
    and the minibuffer or the region which is being completed. Mct does not
    support timer-based auto completion, but the integration into Emacs is
    naturally tight.

  - [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult-completion-in-region]]: The Consult package provides the function
    ~consult-completion-in-region~ which can be set as
    ~completion-in-region-function~ such that it handles ~completion-at-point~. The
    function works by transferring the in-buffer completion to the minibuffer.
    In the minibuffer, the minibuffer completion UI, for example [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][Vertico]] takes
    over. If you prefer to perform all your completions in the minibuffer
    ~consult-completion-in-region~ is your best option.

* Caveats

  Corfu is robust in most scenarios. There are a few known technical caveats.

  - Corfu uses child frames to show the popup. For now Corfu falls back to the
    default setting of the ~completion-in-region-function~ on non-graphical
    displays. You can use one of the alternatives in terminals.

  - Corfu does not sort by history, since ~completion-at-point~ does not
    maintain a history (See branch =history= for a possible solution).
