;;; Commentary:

;; Enable `corfu-history-mode' to sort candidates by their history position.
;; The recently selected candidates are stored in the `corfu-history' variable.
;; If `history-delete-duplicates' is nil, duplicate elements are ranked higher
;; with exponential decay.  In order to save the history across Emacs sessions,
;; enable `savehist-mode'.
